      <h3>Photgraphy Basics</h3>
      <p>Photography for me is a hobby and something I enjoy to do. I wanted to capture my sister in the landscape of our local nature reserve to get a blend of portrait photography with a landscape background. On the first image ‘Charlotte #1’ I wanted to explore the depth of field and focus mainly on the background and surrounding trees. By increasing the depth of field, I was able to make it look like she’s in motion with her background in focus. On image #3 and #4 I was able use the rule of thirds to display the background. Finding a point of focus is of the main things to do when following the rule of thirds rule (J.Dunlop, 2020). Charlotte was my point of focus and I tried to execute it on #3 from a lower angle with high exposure to make the image gain more natural light from the sky.</p>

      <h3>Video Production Basics</h3>
      <p>The video production was something that we as a group put a lot of time into. We started off with a low angle mid-shot of Adriana sat in a well-lit room. We then used fast paced grime music to fit with the quick cut between shots. We wanted to make sure that we had an extreme long shot of the football goal with another camera for a long shot and another as an action camera. One of the things we had to work on was the graphics. We wanted the colour of the graphics to fit in with MOTDx house style so we used one of their graphic and added our own text “Ronaldo Challenge” to show how we had adapted it to fit. Consistency is key when it comes to video production. UP’s Ewan Cameron published a post talking about how video production consistency is important when trying to create brand image (2021) I think this is a fair analysis of the importance of consistency and how it links to brand image. I think brand image is something which MOTDx will see in our production.</p>

      <h3>Social Media Formatting</h3>
      <p>For our social media clip we decided to create a TikTok as we had some footage that we were able to shorten down into a small, snappy video. The purpose of the social media clip is to create something which could be around 10/20 seconds and entertain as most people who are flicking through TikTok as normally the will have a shorter attention spam to new media. Our video starts with Matt and Jack picking up the phone with a rewind next. It doesn’t follow a chronological order which could keep people watching and increase viewership. According to Oberlo there was 689 million monthly users on TikTok (2021) which just highlights the importance of why we chose this app perhaps over Instagram or twitter. We know that MOTDx has a young target audience – the same audience which has grown TikTok to one of the biggest social platforms in the world.</p>
